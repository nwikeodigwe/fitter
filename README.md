# Description

This repository contains the code for a restful API for a wardrobe manager app. The idea is to manage daily style and track wardrobe items. Users are able to create and share style from combining different wardrobe items and assign them to a collection of styles.

# Usage

You can contribute to this repository otherwise fork and extend features. I have also built this project into a docker container and hopefully in the future turn it into a microservice.

run `docker compose up --build`

You can also run test

run `docker compose exec -it app npm test`
